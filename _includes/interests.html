			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Machine learning</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning. I'm particularly interested in voice detection and distinguishing between two voices.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>VR </b>. I just got my vr setup so that the wires are invisible and the sensors can be turned off via a lightswitch for convenience. I'm interested to see how the software side of VR develops into something that could be use for therapuetic and entertainment purposes.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Running</b>. In high school I was in track and cross country.  I still run often to make sure my resting heart rate can stay below 50 bpm.
      </li>
			</ul>
